\section app Application code
<p>
The applications starting code (gray boxes in the class diagram below) depends on the operating system 
In all cases we have the most outer shell of the application that handles the window and the
OpenGL context creation and passes then the events to a thin C-function interface
before it is handled by the C++-framework in the library lib-SLProject.
The following OS are supported and applications are provided for demonstration:
<ul>
    <li>
        Windows, Linux and Max OSX applications can use the <a href="http://www.glfw.org/">GLFW</a>
        C-library for the platform independent window and context creation.
        GLFW is included in the SLProject repository. See the app-Demo-GLFW for demonstration.
    </li>
    <li>
        Windows, Linux and Max OSX applications can also use the <a href="http://qt-project.org/">Qt</a>
        C++-library for the window and context creation. Qt has to be downloaded and installed additionally.
        See the app-Demo-Qt for demonstation.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Android application starts in JAVA and passes the events with JNI (Java
        Native Interface) to the C-interface. See the <a href="https://github.com/cpvrlab/SLProject/wiki/Build-for-Android">
        wiki for build instructions</a> and the app-Demo-Android for demonstration.
    </li>
    <li>
        On Apple iOS Devices the application starts in ObjectiveC before it passes the
        events to the C-interface. See the <a href="https://github.com/cpvrlab/SLProject/wiki/Build-for-Apple-iOS">
        wiki for build instructions</a> and the app-Demo-iOS for demonstration.
    </li>
    <li>
        You could in fact use any GUI library on any OS that can create OpenGL contexts.
        Other alternatives could be e.g.
        <a href="http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/">freeglut</a>,
        <a href="http://www.fltk.org/index.php">FLTK</a>,
        <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a>,
        <a href="http://www.nanapro.org/en-us/">Nana</a> or
        <a href="http://www.juce.com/">Juce</a>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

\section Scene Scene classes
<p>
The blue classes form the center of the SLProject framework:
<ul>
    <li>
        SLInterface.h and SLInterface.cpp define the C-Interface of the SLProject library.
        We use a C-interface because this type can be called from any higher level language.
        The SLInterface talks only to the SLScene and SLSceneView classes.
    </li>
    <li>
        SLScene is the toplevel class of the framework that represents the scene with
        its properties. The scene content is created in SLScene::onLoad.
        It also holds one or more pointers to SLSceneView instancies.
    </li>
    <li>
        SLSceneView represents a dynamic real time 3D view onto the scene.
        A scene can be shown in multiple sceneviews as demonstrated in the app-Viewer-Qt application.
        A sceneview receives all events (keyboard, mouse, OpenGL etc.) 
        from the GUI via the C-Interface (see SLInterface.h).
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

\section node Scenegraph classes
<p>
SLNode is the major building block for the the scenegraph structure (green classes)
and can have 0-N children nodes and 0-N triangle meshes.
A node can be transformed (translated, rotated and scaled) in 3D-space.
<ul>
    <li>
        SLLightSphere and SLLightRect are from SLNode derived and define lights 
        that can be placed and directed in space.
    </li>
    <li>
        SLCamera that defines the view to the scene.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

\section mesh Mesh classes
<p>
SLMesh is the base class for triangulated or wireframed meshes (pink classes). A
mesh is rendered with a material defined in SLMaterial.
A mesh has all the vertex attributes such as position, normals, texture coordinates.
The triangles are defined by indexes into the vertex attribute arrays.
<ul>
    <li>
        SLRevolver, SLSphere, SLCylinder, SLCone, SLBox, SLPolygon and SLRectangle are all
        inheritants from SLMesh and represent the according platonic shapes.
    </li>
    <li>
        SLAABBox and SLUniformGrid implement the space partitioning.
        Every SLNode has an axis aligned AABB that is used for fast frustum culling and ray shooting.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

\section material Material classes
<p>
SLMaterial is the core of the yello classes that define the appearance of a mesh.
A material can have one or more texture images and is rendered with a specific shader programm written
in the OpenGL shading language (GLSL).
<ul>
    <li>
        SLGLTexture defines a texture image with filtering parameters.
    </li>
    <li>
        SLGLProgram defines a shader program with at least one vertex and one fragment shader program.
    </li>
    <li>
        SLGLShader defines a vertex or fragment shader where the source code is read from a file.
    </li>
    <li>
        All OpenGL ES 2.0 code is restricted to the classes beginning with SLGL.
        (SLGLState, SLGLTexture, SLGLBuffer, SLGLShader and SLGLProgram)
     </li>
    <li>
        The linear algebra math is implemented in the classes SLMat3, SLMat4, SLVec3, SLVec4 and SLQuat4.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

\section animation Animation classes
<p>
The red animation classes provide the functionality for simple node animations or skeleton animations.
<ul>
    <li>
        SLAnimManager: A single instance of this class is hold by the SLScene instance and is
        responsible for updating the enabled animations and to manage their life time.
        If keeps a list of all skeletons and node animations and also holds a list of
        all animation playback controllers. The update of all animations is done before
        the rendering of all SLSceneView.
    </li>
    <li>
        SLAnimPlayback manages the playback state and the local time of an SLAnimation.
        It manages the way the time advances and how the animation loops. It has all
        functionality to play, pause, stop, enable, speedup and slowdown a playback.
        A list of all SLAnimPlayback is hold by the SLAnimManager.
    </li>
    <li>
        SLAnimation is a container for multiple SLAnimTrack that build an animation.
        E.g. a walk animation would consist of all the SLAnimTrack that make a
        SLSkeleton walk. It also knows the length of the animation.
    </li>
    <li>
        SLAnimTrack and SLNodeAnimTrack: An animation track is a track that affects a
        single SLNode or an SLJoint of an SLSkeleton by interpolating its transform.
        It holds therefore a list of SLKeyframe. For a smooth motion it can interpolate
        the transform at a given time between two neighboring SLKeyframe.
     </li>
    <li>
        SLKeyframe and SLTransformKeyframe define a transform at a certain time on an
        SLAnimTrack.
    </li>
    <li>
        SLSkeleton: An skeleton is used to animate a hierarchical object like a human being.
        An SLSkeleton keeps track of its bones (SLJoints) in a tree structure and
        points with _root to the root node of the skeleton hierarchy.
        An SLSkeleton is not actively transforming any SLNode in the scenegraph.
        It just keeps track of its transformed SLJoint.
        A mesh that is associated with a skeleton transforms all its vertices every
        frame by the joint weights (Jw). Every vertex of a mesh has weights for four joints
        by which it can be influenced.
    </li>
    <li>
        SLJoint is specialized SLNode that represents a single joint (or bone) in a skeleton
        The main addition of SLJoint to the base SLNode is the offset matrix which is the
        inverse transformation of the joint's binding pose in mesh space.
        It is used to transform the vertices of a rigged SLMesh to the origin of the joint
        to be able to manipulate them in the join's space.
    </li>
</ul>
